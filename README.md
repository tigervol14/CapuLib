# How To Use

Here is a tutorial on how to use CapuLib.

## Player Module

The Player module has multiple different functions to control the player & more!

Change Bounce:
The Change bounce function is pretty straight forward! You are able to use this method to do it.
```CapuLib.Modules.Player.ChangeBounce(100)```
You are able to change the 100 at the end to any number you want, the less the number the more bouncy it is.
If you want to change it to the default put the number 200.
